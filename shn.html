            <pre>
History. The city of Ozamiz grew out of an old Spanish town called Misamis. Misamis developed because of the Spanish
    garrison stationed at the stone fort called Nuestra Senora dela Concepcion del Triunfo, which was built
     some time in the 18th century to control the pirate activities in the nearby Lanao area.</pre><br>

                <p>The blessed Virgin of Cotta of Ozamiz
                     was built in 1755 by Father Jose Docus
                     in order to serve as the frontier
                      settlement of 
                      Spanish rule in Mindanao. 
                     The image has been referred to as

                       Kotta” or Virgin 
                     of the fort but the actual title
